After I graduate, I hope to go into either healthcare or federal/nonprofit consulting

# What I hope to learn
I've seen some wonderful agencies doing great work (Peace Corps, National Park Service, Big Brothers Big Sisters) but unable to convince outside funders or the public to support them to the maximum extent. As nonprofits and government agencies increase their Monitoring & Evaluation offerings, they should also be focused on using their data to convince people to provide support or become advocates. I want to be a part of this process!
